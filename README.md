# Human Single-Cell Recording - UCLA Data Spike Sorting

This repository contains my leisure exploratory analysis of a 30-minute multi-unit recording in the **Medial Temporal Lobe** of an epileptic patient, obtained from Itzhak Fried's lab at UCLA. The dataset is authored by Rodrigo Quian Quiroga and was posted on December 9, 2019 on the Leicester University dataset webpage.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis utilizes Combinato, an algorithm for spike detection and sorting. This project serves as a trial for me to explore the dataset and familiarize myself with the analysis of intracranial single-cell electrophysiological recordings. Combinato is a user-friendly tool that simplifies the process of handling and analyzing neural recordings.
